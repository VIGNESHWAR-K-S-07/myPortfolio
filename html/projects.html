                <p>The main goal of this project is to develop an user friendly blog page to share the user's favorite
                    books and Name of the book, Title of the book,
                    Author of the book and Description of the book. HTML is used in this project to structure and layout
                    of the website. CSS is used to provide an impressive decorations to the website. JS is used to do
                    some important functions and make the website dynamic. </p>

                </div>
                <p>The aim of the project is to provide an user friendly TODO list to track the user's action. This
                    website allows the users to create their own todo list and helps the users to track and follow the
                    actions in the Order.
                    In this project, the website's layout and the structures were designed by using the technology HTML.
                    The styles and fonts were designed by using the technology CSS. The functions and scripts were
                    designed by using the technology JavaScript.

                <p> Crime pattern analysis is a crucial facet of modern law enforcement, aimed at understanding and
                    mitigating criminal activities. This project delves into the systematic study of crime patterns,
                    utilizing data-driven techniques in Python to uncover trends and hotspots. By analyzing various
                    aspects such as geographical locations, time frames, and crime types, this research provides
                    valuable
                    insights into criminal behavior. The project employs advanced Python libraries like pandas, NumPy,
                    scikit-learn, and geospatial libraries to process and interpret crime data. The study explores the
                    integration of Python-based machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of crime pattern
                    predictions. The project underscores the significance of effective communication and collaboration
                    between law enforcement agencies and the community, facilitated by Python-based data visualization
                    libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. By engaging citizens and sharing information about crime
                    patterns through interactive visualizations, a collaborative approach to crime prevention and
                    community safety can be achieved.

                <p>With the rapid development of internet technology, the scale of online transactions is constantly
                    expanding. At
                    the same time, the related network transaction fraud problem has become more significant. Compared
                    with the credit
                    card transaction, the network transaction has the characteristics of low cost, wide coverage and
                    high frequency,
                    which makes the detection of fraud more complex. To identify online payment fraud with machine
                    learning, we need
                    to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. For this,
                    we need a dataset
                    containing information about online payment fraud, so that we can understand what type of
                    transactions lead to
                    fraud. By collecting a dataset from Kaggle , which contains historical information about fraudulent
                    transactions
                    which can be used to detect fraud in online payment. The online fraud transactions various methods
                    have been used in existing system. In proposed system we use Decision Tree Classifier for finding
                    the fraudulent transactions and the accuracy of those transactions.</p>
